/**
 * Set up the traffic light
 * ------------------------
 * Description
 * What is a system without parameters? The traffic light should work the way users want it. Everything is simple â€”
 * provide input and get the corresponding program's output.
 * ------------------------
 * Objectives
 * In this stage, after the welcoming line, ask the users to input the desired number of roads and input the interval
 * at which the roads should open/close. After each request, read the value that a user provides.
 * Next, implement a looped selection menu. The loop (as well as the program execution) ends when a user selects 0 as
 * the desired option. Any other option (1, 2, 3) prints an informational text on the action performed (add, delete,
 * system) for each option.
