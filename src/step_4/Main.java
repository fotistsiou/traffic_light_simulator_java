/**
 * Like a clockwork
 * ----------------
 * Description
 * Creating a whole system at once is challenging, so we will start with a simple stopwatch in the new thread.
 * Let's assume that our program has three possible states:
 * Not Started — the state until the initial settings have been provided;
 * Menu — the state we worked with earlier. It shows possible options and processes the user's input;
 * System — the state that shows the user information about our traffic light, such as time from startup and initial
 * settings for now.
 * When the user provided input for initial settings (both the number of roads and the interval), create a new thread to
 * implement the System state. Name it as QueueThread by calling its setName() method with the corresponding string
 * argument. The actions this newly-created thread should perform for now each second are:
 * Increasing the variable that corresponds to the amount of time since the "system startup" each second (1000
 * milliseconds);
 * (if in System state) Printing the system information.
 * Let's add new functionality to the Open system menu option. By choosing 3 option in Menu, the program switches to the
 * System state, and the main thread waits for input from the user. To return to the Menu state, the user should press
 * Enter, in other words, an empty string should be provided as input.
 * Example of system information output:
 * ! 3s. have passed since system startup !
 * ! Number of roads: 1 !
 * ! Interval: 1 !
 * ! Press "Enter" to open menu !
 * From this stage and beyond, the testing process can take some time.
 * ----------------
 * Objectives
 * Implement the System state as described above and set its thread name as QueueThread. While your program is in the
 * System state, the output should contain the following information, updated (printing out) each second:
 * The line that shows the time since the program's start (contains only one integer — the number of seconds);
 * The line that indicates the number of roads provided by the user (includes the number substring and only one integer
 * — the same value that was provided in the settings);
 * The line that shows the interval provided by the user (contains the interval substring and only one integer — the
 * same value that was provided in the settings);
 * The line that asks the user to press Enter to open the menu (should contain the Enter substring)
 * When the user provided an empty input, the program should switch back to the Menu state and show the previously
 * implemented menu.
 * The created QueueThread thread should be terminated when the program is finished.
