/**
 * Over and over again
 * -------------------
 * Description
 * Expand the created stopwatch into a road management system. Implement the circular queue that contains roads and add
 * functionality to the remaining options in the menu.
 * -------------------
 * Objectives
 * In this stage, we will add functionality to the Add road and the Delete road options. Expand the QueueThread system
 * by implementing a circular queue, where the maximum number of roads is the value provided in users' settings.
 * When the user selects 1 as an option, print a line containing the input substring, followed by an input for a new
 * element.
 * If the queue is full, the program should inform the user about that with the queue is full substring
 * Otherwise, add this element to the end of a queue and inform users with the add substring and the element's name
 * When the user selects 2 as an option:
 * If the queue is empty, the program should inform users with the queue is empty substring
 * Otherwise, delete the element from the start of the queue and inform users with the delete substring and the
 * element's name.
 * Also, expand the output of the system information. If the queue is not empty, print all the elements' names line by
 * line in the queue from front to rear, just like in the example.
